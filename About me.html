					Hi there! I'm Bart Koning, a first-year Creative Technology student at the University of Twente. I enjoy technology as a whole and really want to explore my passions within the field.<br>
					In my free time, I like to tinker and play with various sorts of technology. From training my own AI models to making my own devices. <br>
					Apart from technology, I also enjoy climbing. When I came to the University of Twente, I joined the TSAC and fell in love with it straight away. Before coming here, I already enjoyed climbing, but now I'm finally able to do it a couple of times a week.
					Which is something I didn't have time for before.<br> Apart from climbing, I also like to play the drums. I've been playing for about three years now and would like to join a band here someday. I used to be in a band, but we sadly all decided to go study in different places.
					My favorite music genres are rock, grunge and some metal, because it's just so nice to hit the drums as hard as possible! Sadly, I'm not able to drum as much as I used to anymore. At home in Groningen, I've got my own drum kit, to use every day. But I can only get access to one every now and then here...<br>
					<br>
					Of course I also like to hang out with friends, watch series, and play video games, just like everyone else. My favorite book/film series is most likely Lord of the Rings, just because that world is so masterfully made.
					When I'm with friends, I mostly like to chat, play games, or go out partying, but I'm up for anything really!!<br>
