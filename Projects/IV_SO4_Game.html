                    For the Interactive Visualization course, I developed a 3D interactive experience in Unity. 
					The project began with several smaller sign-off assignments focused on learning Blender. 
					After that, the first major assignment involved modeling a traditional Japanese house, including interior elements such as chairs, paintings, and vases.
					<br><br>
					Once the model was complete, two additional sign-off assignments followed, during which the 3D model was imported into Unity and enhanced with interactive elements such as moving doors and terrain. 
					The final result is playable using the button below.
