					As an assignment for Professional Development, I took a soldering workshop. I have soldered before, but I was curious on what techniques I didn't know yet.
                    For the workshop, we started with the basics of soldering pins onto a breadboard and gradually did some more advanced things. 
                    I had never used a solder sucker before this workshop, and definitely learned some new techniques!<br><br>
					After completing the course, I decided to fix my Logitec G PRO X Superlight, because the scrollwheel potentiometer broke this summer.
					I spend quite a bit of time removing the old solder and cleaning the area, especially because I needed to be really careful not to break the really thin PCB.
					After that was fully removed, I soldered the new potentiometer in place and reassembled the mouse.
