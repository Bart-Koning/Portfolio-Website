                <p>
                    I started making this website as an assignment for Computer Science in high school. For that class, I made a complete outline for a website, with navigation bar, pages, etc.
                    I also learned the basics of HTML and CSS, which allowed me to improve upon that website this time around.<br>
                    To make this site, I used my previously acquired skills and some help from the internet and ChatGPT to build this site. <br><br>
					At the moment of writing this (12-01-2026), I have added more logic to the website. I finally learned how to make a NavBar and Footer javascript manager, so that I only need to change the code once to update it on every site.<br>
					I am also slowly finding out how I want to structure the website and what I want to add to it.
                </p>
                <br><br><br>
				This website is still a WIP, but this page will be updated once more progress is made.
